      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Charles was born on December 26, 1791 in London, England and passed away on October 18, 1871. His parents were Benjamin Babbage and Elizabeth Teape; he had three siblings. Charles attended Trinity College at Cambridge, England in 1810. With John Herschel, George Peacock and several other friends, he founded Analytical Society in 1812. He was the top mathematician, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. 
      He was a lecturer at the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815. Charles received his master’s degree (MA) in 1817.</p>
      <p> Charles was welcomed into the Royal Society of London in 1816. He tied the knot with Georgiana Whitmore in 1814 and brought eight children into the world. After graduation he applied for different teaching positions, but did not get the job, and had to depend on his father's support. From 1828 to 1839, Babbage worked as professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. He died at the age of 79 and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.</p>

      <h2>Inventions</h2>
      <h3>Difference Engine</h3>
      <img src="./images/DifferenceEngine.jpg" alt="Difference Engine picture">
      <p>Charles is an English inventor and a mathematician who conceived of the idea of the Difference Engine and the analytical machine. The Difference Engine was meant to be a calculator to help solve the problem with tablets. Armies relied heavily on these tablets when firing at opponents, though it would take some time when creating one for a new weapon. Charles was confident that the Difference Engine can solve the army’s problem and asked for the English government for funding. The government gave him the green light and he started to build the engine in 1823. While the idea looked promising, the Difference Engine wasn’t able to be finished due to it being ahead of its time. The Difference Engine was finally constructed in 1991 by historians, they were able to complete it by following the drawings that Charles made.</p>

      <h3>The Analytical Machine</h3>

      <p>During his time building the Difference Engine between the 1920s and 1930s, Charles began to think above and beyond. Despite his failure with the engine, Charles proposed the idea of the Analytical Machine. The Analytical Machine was meant to be the first computer and to be able to solve complex mathematical problems. Charles envisioned the Analytical Machine to be chaperoned by one person and to be powered by steam. Just like the Difference Engine, the machine was partially built and was not fully constructed.</p>
